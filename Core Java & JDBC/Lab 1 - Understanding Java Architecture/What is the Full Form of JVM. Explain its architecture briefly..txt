2) What is the Full Form of JVM. Explain its architecture briefly.
--> 
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.
It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.
A JVM is responsible for loading a file that has been written and compiled into a .class file.

First, Java code is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines
Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.
JVM in Java is responsible for allocating memory space.
JVM architecture in Java contains classloader, method area, heap, JVM language stacks, 
PC registers, native method stacks, execution engine, native methods interface, native methods
libraries.
