1) Method Overloading:-
Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but with different parameters
Overloaded methods can be defined in the same class. 
It is also known as compile polymorphism or static polymorphism.
Overloaded methods may or may not have the same return type.
The access modifier may or may not be different for overloaded methods in the same class.
	

2) Method Overriding:-
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
It is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism.
It involves a superclass and a subclass relationship.
Overriding methods must have the same return type as the overridden method in the superclass.
Overriding methods cannot have a more restrictive access modifier.
However, it can have a less restrictive or the same access modifier.
